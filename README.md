# PersonalPage
This is a project made with the intent of exploring and learning HTML and CSS, simultaneously building my personal information page.
There is a figma prototype of the work i wanted to accomplish.
To run simply download the HTML, CSS and JSON files, right click in the HTML file and choose Run with Live Server (these instructions work for VSCODE).
