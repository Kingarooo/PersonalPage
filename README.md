# PersonalPage
This is a project made with the intent of exploring and learning HTML and CSS, simultaneously building my personal information page.
The Photos folder contains every .png and background I used.
There is a figma prototype of the work I wanted to acomplish.
To run simply download the HTML, CSS and JSON files, right click in the HTML file and choose Run with Live Server (these instructions work for VSCODE).
